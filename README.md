# Future-message
This is a simple scheduler of monthly messages to myself. The basic idea is to send my future self a message from the past. The intended scheduling is planned to be about one message per month for the next 75 years or so. The basic scheduling is like this: message recorded in MM/YY is planned for the year YY+4*MM. This spreads one year of messages to 48 years. To ensure there is some videos of young me for old me with an age difference of more than 48 years, younger versions have to record more than one message per month. See `schedule.txt` for an overview. It is intended to stop at 100 years, which means that the remaining years will have fewer recordings.
